# Meteor Saber

This mod dont have a Steam Workshop page since it was made due to so many people asking in the modding discord about how to properly replicate the velocity of custom projectiles on a creature. This particular one shoots a couple of meteors as an attack.

[This is an example of this attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiF62yCuckM), do mind that this is another creature though.

## Installation / Usage

Extract the files into your ARK mods folder, \ARKEditor\Projects\ShooterGame\Content\Mods\. 

You should not need to restart your kit, but its always recommended.
